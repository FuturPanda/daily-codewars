# A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

# For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcissistic:

#     1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
# and 1652 (4 digits), which isn't:

#     1^4 + 6^4 + 5^4 + 2^4 = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16 = 1938
# The Challenge:

# Your code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10.

# This may be True and False in your language, e.g. PHP.

# Error checking for text strings or other invalid inputs is not required, only valid positive non-zero integers will be passed into the function.

# --- My Solution
# def narcissistic( value ):
#     narcissistic_num = 0
#     for num in str(value) : 
#        narcissistic_num += (int(num) ** len(str(value)))
#     return narcissistic_num == value

# Highest Scoring Word

# Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

# Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

# For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

# You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

# If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

# All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

# def high(x):
#     words = x.split(" ")
#     letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
#     scores = []
#     for word in words : 
#         score = 0
#         for letter in word : 
#             score += (letters.index(letter)+1)
#         scores.append(score)
#     max = [scores[0], 0]
#     for i in range(1, len(scores)):
#         if scores[i] > max[0] : 
#             max = [scores[i], i]
#     return words[max[1]]

# An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

# Example: (Input --> Output)

# "Dermatoglyphics" --> true "aba" --> false "moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)

# isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" = true
# isIsogram "moose" = false
# isIsogram "aba" = false
# --- My Solution
# def is_isogram(string):
#     for letter in string:
#         if string.lower().count(letter) > 1 : return False
#     return True

# Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

# Note: a and b are not ordered!

# Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)
# (1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
# (1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
# (0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
# (1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
# (-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
# (-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)
# Your function should only return a number, not the explanation about how you get that number.
